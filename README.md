How to Use the Whiskey Rise Click Modifier
Step-by-Step Guide
Open the Program:

Start by locating the executable file of the Click Modifier on your computer and open it.
Set Desired CPS (Clicks Per Second) and Hotkey:

Set CPS:
Once the program is open, you'll see a button or field where you can set your desired CPS.
Click on this button or field and enter the number of clicks per second you want. For example, if you want 10 CPS, type in '10'.
Set Hotkey:
Next, you need to set a hotkey that will enable you to turn the Click Modifier on and off.
Click on the button to set the hotkey. When prompted, press the key or combination of keys you want to use as your hotkey. This can be any key or combination that is comfortable for you, such as F9 or Ctrl+Shift+M.
Activate the Click Modifier:

Use the hotkey you set to toggle the Click Modifier on or off.
When the Click Modifier is active, it will automatically simulate the desired number of clicks per second whenever you use your mouse button (both left and right click if it is a bothclick modifier).
Use in Games:

This tool is particularly useful for games that require frequent clicking, such as Minecraft 1.8.9.
Simply turn on the Click Modifier using your hotkey when you start playing and turn it off when you no longer need it.
Additional Notes
Compatibility: The Click Modifier is designed to work smoothly with Minecraft 1.8.9 but can be used with other clicking games as well.
Customization: You can always change the CPS and hotkey settings as needed by reopening the program and following steps 2 and 3.
Safety: Make sure to use the Click Modifier responsibly. Overusing automated clicking tools can sometimes violate the terms of service of certain games.
By following these steps, you can effectively use the Whiskey Rise Click Modifier to enhance your gameplay experience
